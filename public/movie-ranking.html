<h1>The Best Movies According to Nandini</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Hasee Toh Phasee</h3>
<p>I thought I wouldn't like it, but I ended up watching it thrice.</p>

<h3>O.K. Kanmani</h3>
<p>I thought it was a movie that only certain people could like and didn't watch it when the movie was released. Later I got around to watching it and was obsessed with it for weeks.</p>

<h3>Moxie!</h3>
<p>A friend recommended it to me and I love her a whole lot more now.</p>
